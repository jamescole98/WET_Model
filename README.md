# WET_Model

The WET model is designed as part of a PhD thesis. The aim of the model is to simulate the heating of an icy lunar regolith system. The overall outcome is to explore how different heating methods impacts the overall extraction of water ice from the system.

This repository offers example codes for the WET model. Specifically the base codes for running microwave heating, solar heating, and conductive rod heating. The plotting codes are not included. The three examples codes can be run by choosing the variables of time, input power, heating time and then running on python.
